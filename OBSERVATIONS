A. Memory usage difference between file server and client is huge even for a single client. This implies file system buffering needs to be improved.

B. High Direct Memory and Heap Sizes are important even if Phy Memory is lower than it.

C. Do back of envelope calculations hold?
About 17K requests per second * 28K file size = 450M .
Yet the memory footprint is 11-12GB.

Considering encryption creates a 2x effect, doesnt explain the 20 time gradual growth.

D. The heap size seems to be increasing upto max in a step wise fashion. It does not seem to go down.
CMS seems to have a better profile than G1. It seems to be turning over memory faster.
This may be also because the G1 is not being tuned well.
